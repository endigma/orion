# orion

Orion is a toolchain for building, publishing and consuming Arma 3 scripted compositions. These are currently used primarily on BI's Public Zeus servers which have composition scripting enabled.

Orion has a few main target functions:

- [x] Bundling scripts into a composition format
- [ ] Linting and formatting SQF files
- [ ] Preprocessing SQF files
- [ ] Downloading, managing and using scripted compositions
- [ ] Automating the release of compositions to the steam workshop

Work has only just begun, and even "completed" functions are still considered alpha, and breaking changes _will_ happen before 1.0.
